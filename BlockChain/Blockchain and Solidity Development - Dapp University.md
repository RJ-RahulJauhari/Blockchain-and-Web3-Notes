# Basics of Solidity and Block Chain
### Overview of Blockchain and Solidity

#### **Blockchain Basics**

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. This ledger is secure, transparent, and immutable (unchangeable once recorded). Each record (or "block") is linked to the previous one, forming a "chain" of data that ensures integrity.

- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls the data; instead, it’s shared across all participants.
- **Immutable**: Once data is written to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Transparent**: Transactions are visible to all participants, enhancing trust.

#### **Ethereum and Smart Contracts**

Ethereum is a popular blockchain platform that enables developers to build applications using "smart contracts." A **smart contract** is a self-executing program with rules written into code. When certain conditions are met, the contract executes its instructions automatically.

For example:
- A smart contract for a **voting system** could automatically record each vote and prevent double voting.
- A **crowdfunding contract** could hold funds until a target amount is reached, then release them to the project or return them to contributors if the goal isn’t met.

#### **Solidity**

Solidity is a programming language created for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s similar to languages like JavaScript or C++ but tailored for blockchain development. With Solidity, developers can write contracts that handle money, manage data, and interact with other contracts.

### Basic Solidity Example: A Simple Bank Contract

Here’s a simple example of a smart contract written in Solidity that works like a basic bank account. This contract allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether (Ethereum’s currency) and check their balances.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleBank {
    
    mapping(address => uint) private balances;  // Store each user's balance
    
    // Function to deposit Ether into the contract
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;  // Increase the sender's balance by the amount they send
    }
    
    // Function to check the balance of the caller
    function checkBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return balances[msg.sender];  // Return the caller's balance
    }
    
    // Function to withdraw Ether from the contract
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");  // Check if the caller has enough funds
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;  // Deduct from the caller's balance
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);  // Transfer the amount to the caller
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **pragma solidity ^0.8.0;**
   - This line specifies the version of Solidity used to compile the code. Here, we’re using version `0.8.0` or later.

2. **mapping(address => uint) private balances;**
   - This line defines a `mapping`, which is like a dictionary in Solidity. It associates each address (user’s unique identifier) with a balance (amount of Ether they have).

3. **deposit() Function**
   - This function allows users to deposit Ether into their account by sending Ether with their transaction. The balance of the sender (`msg.sender`) is increased by the value they send (`msg.value`).

4. **checkBalance() Function**
   - This is a view function, meaning it only reads data and doesn’t change the contract’s state. It returns the balance of the caller (the person who called this function).

5. **withdraw() Function**
   - This function allows users to withdraw Ether from their account. It checks if the caller has enough balance, then reduces their balance by the requested amount and transfers the Ether back to them.

---

### How It Works in Practice

1. **Deploying the Contract**: When this contract is deployed, it becomes an independent program on the Ethereum network.
2. **Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Users can call `deposit()` to send Ether to the contract, increasing their balance.
   - They can call `checkBalance()` to check how much Ether they have in the contract.
   - They can call `withdraw()` to take out some or all of their Ether if they have enough balance.

### Summary

Solidity enables developers to create programmable financial applications on Ethereum using smart contracts. Blockchain ensures the security, transparency, and decentralization of these contracts, making it a popular choice for decentralized applications.

# First Contract

This Solidity code defines a simple smart contract named `Counter`. It includes a `count` variable that keeps track of a numeric value, and provides several functions to manipulate this value. Here’s a breakdown of each part:

1. **License Declaration**:  
   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   ```
   This comment specifies the open-source license (MIT) for the code. This is a requirement for Solidity files to help with licensing clarity.

2. **Pragma Directive**:  
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.8;
   ```
   This line specifies the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used to compile this contract. Here, it indicates compatibility with version 0.8.8 or later (up to but not including 0.9.0).

3. **Contract Declaration**:  
   ```solidity
   contract Counter {
   ```
   This line declares the `Counter` contract. Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented programming.

4. **State Variable**:  
   ```solidity
   uint count;
   ```
   This declares a state variable named `count` of type `uint` (unsigned integer). By default, it will be initialized to `0`.

5. **Constructor**:  
   ```solidity
   constructor() {
       count = 0;
   }
   ```
   This is the constructor function, which runs only once when the contract is deployed. It sets `count` to `0`, although it would already be `0` by default.

6. **incrementCount Function**:  
   ```solidity
   function incrementCount() public {
       count++;
   }
   ```
   This function increases `count` by `1` each time it's called. The `public` visibility modifier means it can be called by anyone.

7. **getCount Function**:  
   ```solidity
   function getCount() view public returns(uint) {
       return count;
   }
   ```
   This function returns the current value of `count`. The `view` modifier indicates that the function does not modify the contract's state, making it a read-only function.

8. **decrementCount Function**:  
   ```solidity
   function decrementCount() public {
       count--;
   }
   ```
   This function decreases `count` by `1` each time it's called. It’s worth noting that this function doesn’t prevent `count` from going negative, which may be a risk if called multiple times.

9. **setCount Function**:  
   ```solidity
   function setCount(uint value) public {
       count = value;
   }
   ```
   This function allows the caller to set `count` to any `uint` value passed as a parameter.

10. **resetCount Function**:  
    ```solidity
    function resetCount() public {
        count = 0;
    }
    ```
    This function resets `count` to `0` when called.

### Summary
The `Counter` contract manages a `count` variable and provides functions to increment, decrement, set, retrieve, and reset the value of `count`. This contract could serve as a simple example of state manipulation in Solidity, allowing interaction with the `count` variable through various public functions.

**Full Code**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;
contract Counter{

    uint count;

    constructor() {

        count = 0;

    }

    function incrementCount() public{

        count++;

    }
  
    function getCount() view public returns(uint){

        return count;

    }

    function decrementCount() public{

        count--;

    }

    function setCount(uint value) public{

        count = value;

    }

    function resetCount() public{

        count = 0;

    }
}
```

# Variable and Datatypes in Solidity 

In Solidity, variables and data types play a key role in defining and managing the data within smart contracts. Solidity offers a range of data types, allowing for various operations and storage requirements. Here's an overview:

### 1. **State Variables vs Local Variables**

- **State Variables**:  
  Stored on the blockchain. Declared outside functions and persist as part of the contract's state.
  
- **Local Variables**:  
  Declared inside functions and only exist during the execution of that function. They do not use any blockchain storage (gas).

### 2. **Data Types**

Solidity provides a range of data types, grouped into basic and complex types.

---

### **Basic Data Types**

#### a. Integer Types

- **`uint`**: Unsigned integer, meaning non-negative integers only. You can specify the size (`uint8`, `uint16`, ..., `uint256`), with `uint256` being the default.
- **`int`**: Signed integer, allowing for both positive and negative values. Similar to `uint`, you can specify the size (`int8`, `int16`, ..., `int256`).

**Example**:
```solidity
uint256 public myUint = 123;
int256 public myInt = -123;
```

#### b. Boolean (`bool`)

- Can hold either `true` or `false`.
- Useful for conditional checks and control flow.

**Example**:
```solidity
bool public isTrue = true;
```

#### c. Address (`address`)

- Holds a 20-byte Ethereum address. Used to store addresses of contracts, wallets, etc.
- `address payable` allows an address to receive Ether.

**Example**:
```solidity
address public owner;
address payable public recipient;
```

#### d. Fixed-Point Numbers (Not fully supported)

- Solidity had `fixed` and `ufixed` types for fixed-point arithmetic, but they are not yet fully supported.

#### e. Bytes (`bytes`)

- **Fixed-size**: `bytes1` to `bytes32`, where `bytes32` can hold up to 32 bytes.
- **Dynamic-size**: `bytes`, a dynamically-sized array of bytes.

**Example**:
```solidity
bytes32 public fixedBytes = "Hello Solidity";
bytes public dynamicBytes = "Hello";
```

---

### **Complex Data Types**

#### a. Arrays

- Used to store a collection of elements of the same type.
- Can be **fixed-size** or **dynamic-size**.

**Example**:
```solidity
uint[] public dynamicArray;       // Dynamic array
uint[5] public fixedArray;        // Fixed array of size 5
```

#### b. Structs

- Custom data types that group together variables of different types.
- Useful for defining complex data structures.

**Example**:
```solidity
struct Person {
    string name;
    uint age;
}
Person public person = Person("Alice", 30);
```

#### c. Mappings

- Similar to hash tables or dictionaries, mapping is a key-value store.
- They are used to associate keys with values and are particularly useful for storage.

**Example**:
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public balances;
```

---

### **Special Data Types**

#### a. Enums

- Enums represent a predefined set of values, like options in a dropdown menu.
- Useful for managing states.

**Example**:
```solidity
enum Status { Active, Inactive, Pending }
Status public currentStatus;
```

#### b. Function Types

- Functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments.
- Solidity supports both **external** and **internal** function types.

**Example**:
```solidity
function add(uint a, uint b) pure public returns (uint) {
    return a + b;
}
```

---

### **Data Location**

In Solidity, data can be stored in different locations depending on the context. The main data locations are:

- **Storage**: Persistent storage on the blockchain. Used for state variables.
- **Memory**: Temporary storage during function execution. Used for local variables.
- **Calldata**: Similar to memory but read-only and used for function arguments in external functions.
